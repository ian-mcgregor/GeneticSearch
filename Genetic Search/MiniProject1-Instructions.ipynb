Optionally, you could with the other approach of simulated annealing. We will provide you all the necessary infrastructure for solving the problem. \n",
    "\n",

    "## Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The regression problem is a basic problem of finding a function $y = f(x)$ that passes through some given data points given as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\ldots, (x_n, y_n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is a fundamental problem in machine learning. However, since it is often hard and undesirable to find an exact fit (look up <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting\"> overfitting </a> ), we aim to find a least square fit. I.e, find a function that minimizes the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{min}\\; ( (y_1 - f(x_1))^2 + (y_2 - f(x_2))^2 + \\cdots + (y_n - f(x_n))^2 ) $$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem is that there is no idea what the form of $f$ looks like. Therefore, we need to search for $f$ from a family of functions $\\{ f_1, \\ldots, f_N \\} $. Often, the set of functions in this family is not finite.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** linear regression looks for functions of the form $f: c x+ d$ for some unknowns $c, d$. This is already an infinite family of functions. The problem is complicated for nonlinear functions since we do not know what kind of nonlinear function to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mini-project, we will explore the use of genetic algorithms to search for a function $f$ from among many possibilities to find a function that fits a given set of data points as closely as possibly while making the least-squares loss as small as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "In the figure below: the green 'x' denote the data points $(x_i, y_i)$ and we know secretly that these points have been generated by the function $e^{\\sin(2x)} - e^{\\cos(3x)}$. However, the regression algorithm just sees the data samples. It's goal is to fit a curve (shown in red) that minimizes the least-square error $\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - f(x_i))^2$. In this example, we see that the curve generated by regression is almost a perfect fit with a very small total loss value.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"genetic_alg_fit1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "However, here is a different example, where the green 'x's denote the data and the green curve the exact unknown \"ground truth\" curve that generated the data. The red curve shows the result from regression. Here the fit is not great meaning that the loss value (least square error) is large.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Symbolic Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we represent functions as trees (they will be called _abstract syntax trees_ in your programming languages class).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example__ Consider the function $e^{\\sin(2x)} - e^{\\cos(3x)}$. The abstract syntax tree for this function is shown below:\n",

    "<img src=\"abstract-syntax-tree1.png\" width=\"40%\">\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating Arbitrary Expressions at Random\n",
    "\n",
    "In file `makeRandomExpressions.py` we have implemented an important function `generate_random_expr` that takes in a `depth` parameter, a list of identifier (strings) `lst_of_identifiers` and some parameters (see `geneticAlgParams.py`) that govern how random expressions are generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go ahead and try this code out by running `python3 makeRandomExpressions.py`. If you examine the expressions so generated, you will see that some expressions are not going to be viable:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: ** `(((-5.622601942609484 - -2.0 + (7.645577904681765 * 1.0)) * sqrt(-1.0) * (sin(y)/sin(-2.0))) + (((-2.0 * 0.5 * 1.0 * x * 0.5)/2.167715126398198 - -1.0) * ((x/x)/(-1.0 + -2.0 + -0.8951586596410355))))`\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we are calling `sqrt(-1.0)` which will fail. We need a way to check if an expression is well-defined or \"viable\", perhaps eliminating ones that are not, like the example above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking if an Expression is Viable (Well-Defined)\n",
    "\n",
    "Function `is_viable_expr(expr, lst_of_identifiers, params)` in file `fitnessAndValidityFunctions.py` will check if an expression is well defined by generating a lot of test points over a given range and checking if the function can be successfully evaluated. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fitness Function\n",
    "\n",
    "For a regression problem we wish to __minimize__ the sum of square errors over data. Most genetic algorithms are framed as __maximizing__ fitness. We have implemented a fitness function for you in `fitnessAndValidityFunctions.py` :\n",

    "\n",
    "###  CrossOver and Mutation Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Genetic algorithms require you to implement two operators: _crossover_ and _mutation_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crossover Operator** Sometimes called _mating_, involves two expressions `e1` and `e2`. A crossover selects a subtree (subexpression) each of `e1` and `e2` at random and simply swaps them. the subtree of `e1` now becomes a subtree of `e2` and vice-versa.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `random_subtree_crossover(e1, e2, copy)` in file `crossOverOperators.py` implements a cross over operator for you by selecting subtrees at random. The two expressions `e1` and `e2` are the expressions to cross over. The flag copy is set to `True` if we do not want to mutate `e1` and `e2` but rather work off copies of these expressions. It is advisable to set this flag to `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mutation Operator** Another operation is to mutate a given expression tree at random. We have implemented mutation operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "`random_expression_mutation(e_orig, lst_of_identifiers, params, copy)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This implements three different mutations: select a subexpression at random and replace it with a random expression; or replace the entire expression by the subexpression; or make the subexpression part of a random expression.\n",
